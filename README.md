🌸 Her Jozi Circle

Her Jozi Circle is a community-inspired web project designed to bring women in Johannesburg together through movement, creativity, and connection.

This project is also a learning journey — my hands-on way to master frontend, backend, databases, and APIs while building something meaningful that reflects my passion for community building.



✨ Project Goals

Build a full-stack web application to learn by doing.

Practice frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Understand backend concepts with Flask (Python).

Implement a database to store user signups and event participation.

Create and consume APIs to handle communication between the frontend and backend.

Showcase how technology and community can come together to make a difference.



🚀 Features (Work in Progress)

Homepage with information about the circle and upcoming activities.

Signup & Login functionality for new and existing members.

Events page where members can join walks, jogs, runs, and creative gatherings.

Database integration to securely store user and event data.

API endpoints to connect frontend forms to backend logic.



🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, (basic JavaScript for interactivity)

Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: SQLite (starting simple, expandable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)

APIs: Flask routes serving both HTML and JSON responses



🌍 Why This Project?

Her Jozi Circle isn’t just about code — it’s about community.
I believe in creating spaces where women can:

Move (walk, jog, run together)

Create (knitting, painting, crafts)

Connect (book clubs, coffee dates, sisterhood events)

This project is my way of merging my love for technology with my love for building circles of support and belonging.


📖 Learning Journey

✅ Phase 1: Frontend basics (HTML, CSS, page design).

✅ Phase 2: Backend with Flask (routes, templates, static files).

✅ Phase 3: Databases (user signup storage).

✅ Phase 4: APIs (communication between pages and backend).

🔄 Phase 5: Deployment (sharing the project online).



💡 Future Improvements

Add user authentication (login/logout).

Allow members to RSVP for events directly on the site.

Display dynamic event lists from the database.

Improve UI/UX design for smoother user experience.

API to check weather and update users if event rescheduled

Deploy the project so it’s accessible outside of localhost.
